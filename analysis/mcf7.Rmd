In this analysis, I explore the possibility of the data from the
[Sanford et al eLife paper][sanford2020elife] as a possible "model system" for 

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.align = "center",dpi = 120)
```

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(fastTopics)
library(flashier)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```
